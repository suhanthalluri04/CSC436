CSC 436 Final Project

1. This project allows the user to upload or take a picture of a clothing item and find similar items on popular second-hand marketplaces like Ebay, Depop, Poshmark, and Grailed.
The app will use image classification to narrow down the image to a color and clothing category, and use these as search terms for the marketplaces. The user will provide their photo
and will be provided links to 4 marketplaces. The user can also save their search for future reference. These saved searches are accessible through the side bar on the leftside of the app.

3. Some features I used were the Room database for saving search results, and the Camera and Gallery access to get the user photos. One third-party library I used was the Google ML kit for image classification and Coil for thumbnails.
Some Jetpack features I used are Composobles, AppScaffold, state, lazy lists, alert dialogs, 

4. For what it's worth, I tested my app on on the Medium Phone API 35.

5. I think the parts I went above and beyond on this project are learning how to use the Google ML kit for image classification. Although this doesn't work perfectly, I was able to come up 
with strategies to fine-tune the results slightly.
